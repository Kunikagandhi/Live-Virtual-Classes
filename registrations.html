                        <h2>About Live Virtual Classes</h2>
                        <p>  Virtual classroom is an online learning environment, just like in a real-world classroom. A student in a virtual classroom participates in synchronous instruction, which means that the teacher and students are logged into the virtual learning environment at the same time.From inception our classes were designed to bring the benefits of traditional instructor-led training to the internet, bundled with live Q & A, labs, study guides, mentors and offline training options. Today we deliver a training experience that is more effective for skill development and certification prep than anything on the market.

                            Our instructors underpin every mode of learning in the offering, from providing subject-matter expertise during development and professional classroom presentation, to the delivery of mentoring, class notes, and study guides.</p>
